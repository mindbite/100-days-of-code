# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the html and css of my Twitch.tv project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've finally got to use media query. Tomorrow I'll be focusing on the actual functionality of the web app.

### Day 2: June 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Wasn't able to start working on the API as planned but at least I get to practice JS without looking at any reference. 

**Thoughts** I know that there is probably a shorter method using jquery but it is also important to practice things by just trying to remember or figure it out from the mind. This is a good way to strengthen the fundamental knowledge.
